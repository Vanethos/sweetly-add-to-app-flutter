# Sweetly

Native Android app with Flutter Integration.

The objective of this app is to show how to use Flutter inside a current Native app, as such, 
this app navigates to a Flutter, asks the user to choose an item and then send that information
back to the Android application so that it can show the information in a new `Activity`

# Getting Started
